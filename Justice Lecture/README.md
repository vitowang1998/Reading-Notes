### Lecture 1: What's the Right Thing To Do?
---
The course starts with a famous example of killing one or five people when you are a train driver.

I recorded some points of views from the students.

**Student A:**
It's better to kill one person instead of killing five people.

**Student B:**
The people who chose to kill less people on the unfortunate plane in 9.11 are considered as heroes.

---

The professor changes the circumstance to: You can choose either to kill an innocent man to stop the train, or you can watch the five men die.

Why can people endure the death of one person in the first case but cannot in the second?

**Student C:**
He deems that the action of "pushing someone down" is a strong signal of the involvement of a man's death so that most people decide not to kill him.

**Student D:**
In the first circumstance, the driver has to make a choice; while in the second circumstance, this choice is not "necessary". The action of "pushing someone down" and "stirring the wheel" are different.

**My view:**
In our subconscious, we consider the state of "being on the track" as the condition of "actively involved" in the case, anyone not on the tract, should not be sacrificed/hurt in the case.

---

The professor changed the circumstance to: You are a doctor, there are 5 slightly-injured patients and 1 serverly-injured patient. If you choose to save the one, the rest 5 will die.

Most people decide to choose the 5 in this case.

---

The professor changed the circumstance to: You are a doctor with 5 injured patients who need immediate organ transplants, and, there is an innocent, perfectly health man, will you sacrifice him to save the 5?

Most people choose not.

**Student 5**
How about use the first-dead patient's organ to save the 4 rest people.

**Moral Principle:**

Consequentialist:
> locates the morality in the consequences of an act.

Categorical Moral C
> locates the morality in certain duties and rights

---
**Consequentialist:**
Representation: utilitarianism
**Categorical Morial Reasoning**
Representation: Immanuel Kant

**My view:**
Utilitariansim is beautiful and fragile, like a piece of diamond. A society where everyone serves everyone else is too perfect to be true. We are living in a far worse society than a utilitrian one, however it's the best in human history. Confrontations between people is the major theme of the society since it was formed thousands of years ago. What we should do, is not to try eliminating the confrontations, but to make good rules so that the rights of people can be protected. In a sense, confrontation is also the reason why a society is dynamic.

---
**Professor:**
Philosophy reveals some aspects in life that we don't recognize before. Once philosophy tells us about those things, they will never be the same as before.

However, **politically**, philosophy turns you into a **better citizen** if you can keep your goodwill deeply in your heart.

Kant suggests that skepticism is a temporry harbor for human reasoning. However, there does not exist a permanent settling.

**My view:**
There is huge difference between Chinese people and Western people.
