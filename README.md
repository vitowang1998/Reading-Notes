# Reading-Notes
This repository contains my notes for the books I read. Please note that for some books, the notes may be written in Chinese. I am particularly interested in geopolitics, political science, and philosophy, despite the fact that I am actually a Computer Science major.
# Licence
The licence of each note will be added in its coresponding folder specifically. Be advised that different licences may apply to different notes.
