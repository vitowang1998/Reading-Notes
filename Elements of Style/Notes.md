## Introduction
This is a book that I have heard for long. [The Elements of Style](http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~presnell/Various/Strunk-and-White/etes_htm.htm#ch1) is one of the most influential writing guide for American English. The author, William Strunk, Jr., illustrates the way of writing academic English with this small, but important book.




  
   
   
## Elementary Rules of Usage







### **1. Possessive case of a noun**

#### For the possessive case of a singular noun, we add an apostrophe and a "s" at the end of the noun regardless what its final consonant is. Thus we have,
- Charles's teacher
- Frances‘s classmates
- The emperor's throne
- The witness's testimony
- Jones's assignment
- Vitex's flavor


#### There are some expections for the possessive cases of the ancient proper names ending in -es and -is, the possessive *Jesus'*, and such forms as *for conscience' sake*, *for righteousness' sake*. However, such forms as Moses' Laws and Isis' temple are commonly replaced by
- The laws of Moses
- The temple of Isis
- The heel of Achilles

#### The nominal possessive pronouns have no apostrophe. Thus we write,
- This book is hers.
- He is a friend of mine.

#### The adjective possessive pronouns have no apostrophe. Thus we write,
- Her book is great.
- His assignments is annoyingly hard.


#### Indefinite pronouns use an apostrophe to show possessions.
- One's rights
- Somebody's wallet
- Somebody else's paperwork







### **2. Enumeration**
#### In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, add a comma after each term except for the last. (Such commas are also known as the "serial" comma) Thus we write,
- red, blue, and black
- Which color do you want? Red, blue, or pink?
- How can you persuade your supervisors, find the problem, and tackle it?


#### For the name of firms, the last comma is usually omitted. The following example is the name of an individual firm.
- Little, Brown and Company Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette








### **3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas**
#### Common parenthetic expressions
There is an example for this idea.
> The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.

According to the book, 
> This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether a single word, such as however, or a brief phrase is or is not parenthetic.

However, 
> If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight, the commas may be safely omitted.

Thus, we can have some examples
- The most efficient way of dealing with this problem, unless you've studied calculas by yourself somewhere, is to take two points on the graph of the function and calculate its average rate of change on that specific interval.
- The only thing we could do for now, if you don't mind, is to do a M.R.I. test to him and try to identify what disease he has.
- I am sorry to tell you, if you are not that hurry, I have to keep you for 5 more hours.
- My brother, you will be pleased to hear, is in great health now.




#### Appositive clause is another form of parenthetic expression
An appositive is a noun, or noun phrase that explains another noun right after that noun.

##### If the appositive clause is in the middle of a sentence, we add commas before and after it.
- The founder of Facebook, Inc, Mark Zuckerberg, is now 33 years old.
- Dr. House, a world-famous diagnostician, tells the girl's parents that she will be fine after the antibiotic treatment.
- Dr. Gregory House, a bad-tempered, world-famous diagnostician who is phycially disabled, tells the girl's parents that she will be cured, if his diagnosis is correct, after the 6-week-long antibiotic treatment.

##### If the appositive clause is at the beginning of a sentence, it looks like this:
- A bad-tempered, world-famous diagnostician, Dr. House tells the girl's parents that she will be cured after the antibiotic treatment.

##### if the appositive clause is at the end of a sentence, it should like this:
- After the 6-week-long antibiotic treatment, the poor kid's parents are told that their daughter is cured by Dr. Gregory House, a bad-tempered, world-famous diagnostician who is phycially disabled.





#### Dates also contain parenthetic words or figures. The punctuation goes as follow:
 - April to Spetember, 2017
 - February 17, 2017
 - Wednesday, November 14, 1990
##### Note that it is customary to omit the comma in
- 6 April 1988

#### A name or a titile in direct address is parenthetic. A direct address is the name of the person (normally) who is being directly spoken to.
- If, Sir, you refuse, I cannot predict what will happen.
- Well, King, I can conclude that you are in deadly danger.

#### The abbreviations etc., i.e., and e.g., the abbreviations for academic degrees, and titiles that follow a name are parenthetic. Thus, we punctuate them accordingly.

 - Your notes, assignments, etc., are vital to your exam review.
 - Gergory House, Ph.D., gave his speech in that conference.
 - You can edit the binory file with the Java-built-in method, i.e., DataInputStream.
 - Java supports many new software-developing methodologies, e.g., inheritance, override, and polymorphism.
 - Haruki Murahami, writer.
 - The Reverend Harry Lang, S.J.

#### No comma, however, should separate a noun from a restrictive term of identification.
 - The novelist J.K. Rowling
 - William the Conqueror
 - The poet Sappho
 - Attila the Hun

#### Although Junior, with its abbreviation Jr., has commonly been regarded as parenthetic, logic suggests that it is, in fact, restrictive and therefore not in need of a comma.
